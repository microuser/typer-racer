This is what I did

Here’s what I learned from Plan0.md and README.md:

The game is a head-to-head typing racer built in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly for browser play.
The core features include real-time stats, visual effects, a “ghost” replay, and car/road graphics.
The stack is Rust + WebAssembly, using egui or Yew for UI (preferably egui for simplicity).
The deployment uses wasm-pack or trunk for local dev and web deployment.
The architecture is layered: Presentation/UI → Game Logic → Persistence → Procedural Generation → Testing/Dev.
You asked to “develop the cargo, and main methods of deployment up to creating a user interface.”
This means:

Set up the Rust project (Cargo.toml and structure).
Implement the main.rs entry point.
Set up the build pipeline for WebAssembly (wasm-pack/trunk).
Prepare the skeleton for the UI (using egui, as recommended).
Next steps:

Check if a Rust project (Cargo.toml, src/main.rs) already exists.
If not, create the necessary files for a Rust + egui + wasm-pack project.
Implement the main function and initial UI scaffold (no game logic yet).
Add deployment/build instructions.
Let me check for the existence of Cargo.toml and src/main.rs first.



Read plan 0. and readme.md and develop the cargo, and main methods of deplyment up to creating a user interface. 



To enable VS Code–style debugging with breakpoints for Rust (and optionally for wasm/web), you’ll need to set up the necessary configuration files and tooling. Here’s what’s involved:

For Native Rust Debugging (VS Code style)
Install the CodeLLDB extension in VS Code (recommended for Rust).
Add a .vscode/launch.json file to configure breakpoints and debugging.
Ensure debug symbols are included (default in debug builds).
For WebAssembly Debugging (in browser)
Browser debugging for wasm is possible, but breakpoints are set in the browser devtools, not directly in VS Code. However, you can map source code using source maps generated by wasm-pack or trunk.
There is no seamless “set breakpoints in VS Code for wasm in browser” experience yet, but you can debug Rust code in Chrome/Edge/Firefox devtools.
Next Steps
I will:

Create a .vscode/launch.json for native Rust debugging with CodeLLDB.
Add comments on how to debug wasm in the browser.
Optionally, create a .vscode/tasks.json for running build/test from VS Code.


o implement your request—randomly choosing an extended quote from level/expanded-meditations.json and using its letters as the typing sequence for the race—I will:

Load and parse level/expanded-meditations.json at app startup.
Randomly select one of the "expanded_meditation" strings (using the procedural seed for reproducibility).
Split the selected meditation into a sequence of characters for the typing challenge.
Use this sequence as the "quote" for spell-checking/typing in the race.
Technical Plan:

Add a function to load and parse the JSON file into a vector of MeditationQuote (with only the expanded_meditation field used).
On race start, use the seed to deterministically pick an index from the loaded meditations.
Set the chosen meditation as the only "quote" for the current game.
Next, I will:

Add a dependency on serde_json for JSON parsing (already present).
Add code to load and parse the JSON file at startup.
Select and use a meditation for the typing sequence, based on the seed.
Let's implement this!


I have created an index.html file in your project root that will load the WASM build for Typer Racer in the browser. This file:

Sets up a fullscreen dark background and monospace font for a modern, readable look.
Includes a <canvas id="the_canvas_id"> element, which is what eframe/egui expects for rendering.
Loads the WASM package (pkg/typer_racer.js) using a modern ES module <script type="module"> and calls its init() function.
Handles errors gracefully in the browser console.
You can now:

Run trunk serve or open index.html with a local server to view your WASM build in the browser.
The error about missing index.html should be resolved.
If you need further tweaks to the HTML, want a loading spinner, favicon, or want to customize the web experience, just let me know!

we currently have a build error, but we never finished the UI. or the game. First we wanted to be able to build the interface, but currrently we seems to have a working ui in rust, but with a UI with a simple text, which we want to be the same as the one in the desktop application, and unified codebase where we can use both the system binary and have a warm target deployed with help of hosting via trunk serve via localhost.  Read all the markdown *.md files as requiremnets for design. We want to start bur right now we are stuck at calling start because a large refactor needs to occur.
