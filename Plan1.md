This is what I did

Here’s what I learned from Plan0.md and README.md:

The game is a head-to-head typing racer built in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly for browser play.
The core features include real-time stats, visual effects, a “ghost” replay, and car/road graphics.
The stack is Rust + WebAssembly, using egui or Yew for UI (preferably egui for simplicity).
The deployment uses wasm-pack or trunk for local dev and web deployment.
The architecture is layered: Presentation/UI → Game Logic → Persistence → Procedural Generation → Testing/Dev.
You asked to “develop the cargo, and main methods of deployment up to creating a user interface.”
This means:

Set up the Rust project (Cargo.toml and structure).
Implement the main.rs entry point.
Set up the build pipeline for WebAssembly (wasm-pack/trunk).
Prepare the skeleton for the UI (using egui, as recommended).
Next steps:

Check if a Rust project (Cargo.toml, src/main.rs) already exists.
If not, create the necessary files for a Rust + egui + wasm-pack project.
Implement the main function and initial UI scaffold (no game logic yet).
Add deployment/build instructions.
Let me check for the existence of Cargo.toml and src/main.rs first.



Read plan 0. and readme.md and develop the cargo, and main methods of deplyment up to creating a user interface.
