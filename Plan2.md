# Typer Racer UI Improvement Plan

## Current Status
We've successfully fixed the WebAssembly loading issues and clipboard functionality in the Typer Racer game. The application now loads correctly in the browser and the timer functionality works properly.

## UI Improvement Goals

### 1. Game Interface Enhancements
- **Text Display Area**: Create a clear, visually distinct area where the text to be typed appears
- **User Input Area**: Provide a separate area for user input with real-time feedback
- **Progress Indicator**: Add a visual indicator showing typing progress (e.g., progress bar)
- **Word Highlighting**: Highlight the current word to be typed and mark correct/incorrect typing
- **WPM Counter**: Add a real-time words-per-minute counter alongside the timer

### 2. Visual Design Improvements
- **Color Scheme**: Implement a consistent, eye-friendly color scheme (dark mode by default)
- **Typography**: Use a monospaced font for better character alignment and readability
- **Responsive Layout**: Ensure the UI works well on different screen sizes
- **Animations**: Add subtle animations for transitions and feedback
- **Visual Feedback**: Provide immediate visual feedback for correct/incorrect typing

### 3. Game Flow Enhancements
- **Start Screen**: Create an attractive start screen with game instructions
- **Game Modes**: Implement different game modes (timed, word count, practice)
- **Results Screen**: Design a detailed results screen showing performance metrics
- **Replay Option**: Add ability to replay the same text or start a new game
- **Difficulty Settings**: Allow users to select difficulty levels

### 4. Additional Features
- **Sound Effects**: Optional typing sounds and achievement sounds
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Implement keyboard shortcuts for game control
- **Local Leaderboard**: Store and display best scores locally
- **Text Selection**: Allow users to choose from different text categories
- **Theme Options**: Provide light/dark mode toggle and possibly custom themes

## Implementation Approach
1. First focus on the core game interface (text display, input area, progress indicator)
2. Then improve the visual design and responsiveness
3. Add game flow enhancements (start/results screens, replay options)
4. Finally implement additional features as time permits

## Technical Considerations
- Use egui's built-in widgets and layout system for UI components
- Ensure all UI elements are accessible via keyboard
- Optimize rendering for smooth performance
- Maintain consistent state management between UI and game logic
- Ensure WebAssembly compatibility for all UI components

## Next Steps
1. Implement the basic text display and input areas
2. Add word highlighting and progress tracking
3. Design and implement the start and results screens
4. Add visual polish and animations
5. Implement additional features based on priority
